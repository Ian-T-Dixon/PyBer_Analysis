# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from a ridesharing company, PyBer. We were asked to take the data from the provided .csv dataset and use Python and MatPlotLib to filter the data and provide key metrics on various city types in which the company operates including: total number of rides, total number of  drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.

## Analysis
As seen in the chart below, we can determine that the majority of acitivity is taking place in urban areas, with nearly 3x the amount of rides compared to suburban areas, and 13x the rides in rural areas. However, we can also determine that while the number of rides in urban areas are much higher, that that average length of the ride, and thus the average fare per ride is lowest in urban areas. This is likely due to consumers taking shorter trips to get around the city compared to suburb and rural areas where locations are spread out over larger distances. Additionally, since there is a higher volume of drivers within urban areas, the average fare per driver is much lower than in rural areas.

Additionally, upon analysis of the data for the first 4 months of 2019, we are able to determine that there appears to be peaks in rides during late Febuary, and early March, with a surge in rides in suburban areas near the middle of April.

## Summary
Upon completing the analysis of the data, we would recommend trying to:
- Consider raising prices in urban areas to increase the driver earnings and take advantage of high demand.
- Increase ad spending in rural areas to increase demand, and sign new drivers as needed to fill the demand.
- Urge current drivers in urban areas to operate more in suburban or rural areas to take advantage of higher fares, which will also assist in lowering the driver count and lifting the average fare per driver in urban areas.
